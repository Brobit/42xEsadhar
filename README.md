**Hey, welcome on this project page !** 

It's going to be a collab between *42 & Esadhar* 
So, what's the subject, what are we going to do ?

Our goal is to make a web app where you play a game, the game is simple, you have to paint in a 3d environment, how you do it ?

It's pretty simple, you are a little cube , and other cube attack you, you can survive by dashing on them, when you hit them, they became immobile and take a color.
You can move on x - y - z plan, so every time you fixe a cube that attack you, you make a little paint in your 3d environment, there are predetermined zone that make easier to you to draw, and there is gonna be a button for you to check your paint.
